# Looped In
> A browser extension that displays Hacker News comments for the current webpage

Looped In is a browser extension that displays Hacker News comments for the current webpage in a sidebar. It is written in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org).

Looped In is available from the [Firefox Add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/looped-in) and will be available from the Chrome Web Store pending review. If you'd prefer to clone the repository and run the extension locally, read on.

## Usage

To build Looped In locally, you'll need [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) and [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make).

To obtain a copy of the source code:

    $ git clone git@github.com:jdormit/looped-in.git
    
To build the source code once, navigate to the project root and run:

    $ make clean dev

This will output the generated JavaScript to `ext/js/generated`.
