# Looped In
> A browser extension that displays Hacker News comments for the current webpage

Looped In is a browser extension that displays Hacker News comments for the current webpage in a sidebar. It is written in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org).

Looped In will be available from the Firefox Add-ons site and the Chrome Web Store pending review. If you'd prefer to clone the repository and run the extension locally, read on.

## Usage

To build Looped In locally, you'll need [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) and [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make).

To obtain a copy of the source code:

    $ git clone git@github.com:jdormit/looped-in.git
    
To build the source code once, navigate to the project root and run:

    $ make clean dev

This will output the development build of the compiled extension to `ext`. The development build produces source maps and is significantly faster to compile. If you want a production build, run `make clean prod` instead.

To load the extension locally in your browser, see [instructions for Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) or [instructions for Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

To package the extension for publication, run:

    $ make package

This will package a production build of the extension to `dist/looped-in.zip`.
